This is second project of Udacity's Self Driving Car Nanodegree. To find lane and its curvature on road, computer vision methods i.e. camera calibration, sobel, perspective transformation etc. have been used. For details see [P2.ipynb](https://github.com/pchandra90/advance_lane_lines/blob/master/P2.ipynb) and [writeup](https://github.com/pchandra90/advance_lane_lines/blob/master/writeup.md)
